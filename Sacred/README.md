# Sacred

> Sacred 是一個用來管理實驗參數配置的工具。

Sacred is a tool to help you`configure`, `organize`, `log` and `reproduce experiments`. It is designed to do all the tedious overhead work that you need to do around your actual experiment in order to:

- keep track of all the parameters of your experiment
- easily run your experiment for different settings
- save configurations for individual runs in a database
- reproduce your results
